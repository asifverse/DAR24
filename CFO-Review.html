                            <p>In 2024, Kuwait Telecommunications
                                Company (stc) marked another year of
                                resiliency and strength in a rapidly evolving
                                telecommunications landscape. This year’s
                                financial performance is a testament to
                                our solid financial infrastructure, prudent
                                decision-making, and commitment to a
                                forward-looking strategy that drives our
                                sustainable growth. stc is keen to constantly
                                update its prudent financial plan in line with
                                its corporate strategy as well as short and
                                long term strategic plans in addition to taking
                                into consideration the company's ability to
                                capture investment opportunities.</p>
                            <p>I am pleased to present the financial and
                                strategic highlights of 2024, a year marked by
                                significant achievements and steady progress
                                towards our long-term objectives. Our ability
                                to innovate, expand, and adapt has enabled us
                                to deliver value in a highly competitive market,
                                all while ensuring operational efficiency and
                                maintaining a strong financial position.</p>
                            <p>With an eye on the future, we have always
                                seized suitable opportunities to embrace
                                new technologies, optimize costs, and
                                invest in the core as well as key growth
                                areas, particularly in the Consumer sector,
                                digitization as well as the Enterprise and ICT
                                sectors. Our results reflect the success of
                                these initiatives and the relentless dedication
                                of our team to faithfully execute our corporate
                                strategy.</p>
                            <p>During 2024, stc was upgraded from the
                                Main Market to the Premier Market on Boursa
                                Kuwait, representing a key milestone in our
                                journey as a listed company. Underscoring
                                our commitment to governance excellence
                                and transparency, this promotion reflects
                                the increasing confidence of both local and
                                foreign investors in stc’s financial strength
                                and future prospects, as we continue to
                                meet the highest standards of corporate
                                governance and investor relations. Not to
                                mention that stc was also able to maintain our
                                position in the MSCI and FTSE global stock
                                indexes in 2024, confirming its continued
                                attractiveness to investors internationally.</p>
                            <p>Driven by the stc’s refreshed strategy,
                                “r.e.a.c.h”, which was developed during the
                                fourth quarter of 2024 and that focuses
                                on quality growth, we are keen to invest
                                and allocate the Company’s capital to
                                best serve its mission, vision, business
                                operations and business expansion. The key
                                pillars of "r.e.a.c.h.” strategy is illustrated in
                                strengthening the portfolio of the Consumer
                                sector, expanding our operations in the
                                Enterprise sector, creating an unparalleled
                                experience, promoting market development
                                and achieving business excellence. This, in
                                turn, is aimed at achieving stc’s strategic
                                objectives, as well as short and long business
                                plans, positioning the Company for further
                                growth and value creation for all stakeholders.</p>

                            <p>stc’s financial results in 2024 showcase our

                                in the telecom sector. Through effective
                                financial planning and disciplined resource
                                allocation, we realized good results across
                                key financial metrics, with total revenues of
                                KD 336.5 mn in 2024, representing a growth
                                rate of 2.8% compared to the previous year.
                                stc‘s Revenue is comprised of the Consumer
                                Sector which makes up to 76% of the

                                Sector revenues which accounts for 24% of
                                total revenue, highlighting a well-balanced
                                revenue mix for the financial year ended

                            <p>stc also achieved good levels of EBITDA,
                                which increased by 0.3% from last year
                                reaching KD 85.3 mn in 2024, with an EBITDA
                                margin of 25.3%, This improvement is driven
                                by the ongoing optimization of our revenue mix, coupled with the realization of synergies
                                across our subsidiaries.</p>

                            <p>Net profit reached KD 31.4 million (earnings

                                mn (earnings per share 33 fils) in 2023.
                                This decrease is attributed to our Early
                                Retirement Plan (ERP) of 1.9 mn. Excluding
                                the non-recurring expenses related to the
                                early retirement plan, the net profit for

                            <p>This performance reflects our commitment

                                In line with our strategic focus on innovation
                                and infrastructure development, stc's capital
                                expenditure reached KWD 39.2 million,
                                representing 11.6% of total revenues for 2024,
                                compared to KWD 28.1 million, representing
                                8.6% of total revenues for 2023. The rise in
                                capital expenditure is mainly due to the
                                preparation of launching the advanced 5G
                                technology during 2025. These investments
