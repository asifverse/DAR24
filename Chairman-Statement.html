                                the fiscal year ending 31 December 2024. This
                                report highlights our ongoing commitment
                                and wide-ranging efforts to reinforce stc’s

                                advancing our corporate strategy.</p>
                            <p>In a year marked by global economic challenges
                                and market volatility, we were able to show
                                stc’s unique proposition and resilience,
                                focusing on our operations and technological
                                progress. We have made substantial strides in

                                across Kuwait’s telecommunications and
                                ICT sectors while diligently engaging and
                                supporting all our customers, partners and
                                shareholders. Our dedication to innovation and
                                operational excellence has allowed us not only
                                to adapt to an evolving digital landscape but to
                                set new industry standards, positioning stc for
                                continued success and value creation moving
                                forward.</p>

                            <p>Throughout 2024, stc made meaningful
                                progress towards our vision of leading the
                                digital revolution in Kuwait, with a focus on
                                transformation and synergies as we continue

                                across the country. Therefore, after the
                                successful completion of stc’s “LEAD” strategy
                                over the past couple of years, we refreshed
                                the company’s corporate strategy “r.e.a.c.h.”
                                by the end of 2024, to be adopted for the
                                next three years, to cope with the dynamic

                                and support Kuwait 2035 vision which aims
                                on transforming Kuwait into a financial and

                                Hence, our refreshed strategy focuses on
                                quality growth; thus, differentiating stc in the
                                Kuwaiti telecom market through elevating

                                evolution. Furthermore, we are committed to
                                harnessing our digital capabilities to drive
                                business excellence and building a dynamic

                                optimistic about the operational excellence,
                                financial performance and elevated services
                                that would be achieved by adopting “r.e.a.c.h.”
                                strategy.</p>
                            <p>Responding to the strong demand for digital
                                solutions, we concentrated on enhancing our
