                                Dear Shareholders,
                            </p>
                            <p>As we reflect on a year of progress and
                                achievement, I am proud of the resilience,
                                innovation, and purpose-driven growth
                                demonstrated by Kuwait Telecommunications
                                Company (stc). The strength of our operational
                                and financial performance stands as a
                                testament to our steadfast dedication
                                to fostering innovation and operational
                                excellence.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the year, we were able to
                                successfully navigate a volatile landscape,
                                seizing opportunities and overcoming
                                challenges to reinforce our leadership.
                                Our achievements reflect a clear focus on
                                advancing our strategic objectives, expanding
                                5G infrastructure, enhancing the customer
                                experience, and driving digital transformation
                                – each of which strengthens our position amid
                                the rapidly evolving global telecommunications
                                and ICT sectors.</p>
                            <p>In line with CITRA’s recent regulatory guidance,
                                we took decisive steps to accelerate the rollout
                                of 5G-Advanced (5.5G), setting the stage for
                                next-generation connectivity that delivers
                                faster speeds, lower latency, and seamless
                                integration of AI, machine learning, and other
                                emerging technologies. This deployment
                                also enhances energy efficiency and extends
                                our reach to better serve indoor and rural
                                areas, while boosting network security and
                                enhancing the extended frequency bands. The
                                launch of 5.5G represents a critical step toward
                                future innovations in wireless communication,
                                positioning stc to meet the demands of
                                new industries and the global connectivity
                                landscape. By empowering industries and
                                users alike with next-generation experiences,
                                we drive technological and economic growth
                                alongside sustainable connectivity.</p>
                            <p>Aligned with our digital transformation
                                strategy, we have also made customercentricity
                                a priority, enhancing service
                                offerings and expanding our digital platforms
                                for a more intuitive, personalized engagement.
                                Over the past few years, stc has focused
                                on delivering integrated technical and
                                corporate database solutions to strengthen
                                our competitive position and diversify revenue
                                streams. To that end, we have streamlined
                                processes, improved customer support, and
                                made significant investments in data security, ensuring consistent connectivity and
                                reliability
                                for our valued customers and shareholders.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, it is worth highlighting stc’s
                                commitment to cultivating an exceptional
                                work environment that fosters growth,
                                innovation, and well-being for its workforce,

                                of a 5,698.5 square meter area to be used as an administrative headquarter for stc in
                                Kuwait.
                                This strategic plan which is intended to be
                                implemented over the next four to five years,
                                is also considered a strategic step towards
                                driving long-term cost efficiency.</p>

                                previous year. EBITDA rose by 0.3% to reach KD
                                85.3 million, with net profit reaching KD 31.4
